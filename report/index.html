		<p class="title">Rendering and Moving an Articulated Lamp</p>
      <p class="tagline">A Project by Donovan Alexander</p>

	<div class="content">

        <p>My final project consists of a 3D Model of a lamp broken down into 28 sub-models that are grouped hierarchically to enable articulated movement.
            I used Three.JS, Blender, JavaScript, HTML to create this project. It does not have full functionality due to complications with the exported
            model format and a lack of mechanical knowledge of Three.JS and JavaScript on my end, but it demonstrates proof of concept that hierarchical
            modeling and motion is possible using these methods and APIs. The part of the project that fails is constraining the axes and motions that certain
            parts of the lamp can perform, and forcing the parts of the lamp to rotate about their own origin instead of the world's origin.<br><br>

            How to use:<br>
            *Upon loading the page, the cene, lights, and camera are set up; the project also starts the render animation looop<br>
            *At your own discretion, you can build the lamp with the Make button. This button starts a chain of function calls that allow the lamp to be built
            in the correct order every time; it then creates the hierarchical links necessary to preserve lamp movement<br>
            *You can manipulate the camera with the provided camera control buttons (Left/Right = X-Axis; Up/Down = Y-Axis; In/Out = Z-Axis; Rotations rotate the camera about itself; Focus On Lamp makes the target of the camera the lamp's base)<br>
            *You can manipulate the lamp with the provided demo buttons (Move Base translates the base position right along the world's X-Axis; Rotate B-T-N rotates the base of the neck about the world's Y-Axis;
            Rotate Head rotates the head of the lamp [bulb, switch, cover] about the world's X-Axis; Move B-o-N moves the back of the neck piece left along the world's X-Axis)<br>

            <br>How it works:<br>
            *A model of the lamp is generated in an external 3D Modeling Program (I used Blender) and is exported to a readable format (I used [*].obj)<br>
            *The exported files are then converted to JSON Objects using Three.JS's utility (convert_obj_three.py located in Three/utils/converters/obj)<br>
            *The JSON Object files are read in using Three.JS's Loader (JSON Loader located in Three/examples/js/loaders/AssimpJSONLoader.js) and are then treated as mesh objects<br>
            *The mesh objects for the lamp are loaded into the Three.JS scene created by init.js and are displayed and rendered using the respective Three.JS functions
              -The mesh objects are all stored in an array that maintains the hierarchy to manipulate each part as necessary (this array is named group and is created in init.js)<br>
            *The mesh objects are then manipulated by the functions in finalUtils.js and the buttons given in final.html
              -This is done by manipulating the components (position and rotation values) of the meshes individually; the changes are then propagated to the linked meshes
